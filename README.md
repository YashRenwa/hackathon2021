# MAIL MANAGER

We were assigned to work on a mail manager app. We have built an
app which has a signup and login page and also login through google
sync feature . Then we have a compose mail page with textfield for
From ,To, Subject, Body , a send button on the top and a calender
button which on tapping we get a bottom sheet to schedule mail
according to our requirement.
We can schedule mails weekly , monthly , yearly and also we have
set a recurring schedule feature where we can send a mail
recurringly on constant intervals. We also have an option of
deleting the mails sent previously .
We have made this app using flutter , firebase and backend is
done using python and we have attached it for reference.
